# Fairytale

Once upon a time there was a cat. It was a female but her name was Martin.
She found a male hedgehog named [ovuvuevuevue enyetuenwuevue ugbemugbem osas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfXFfNaMlu8).
Martin lived in a village called [Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llanfairpwllgwyngyll)
He has a habit of being so sharply dressed that he would shave his face with it. and collecting everyday flowers and balloons
																																																																											

...and they lived happily ever after. <!--but what if they didnt?-->
